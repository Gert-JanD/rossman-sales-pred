    This function perform some feature engineering tasks having as input a pandas dataframe. 
    
    - From the Date column, 3 news features (year, day of the month and week of the year) are created and
     when necessary they have their type changed.
     
    - A new feature is obtained dividing the Sales per Customer per Store.
    
    - One hot encoding and target encoding techniques are applied to some categorical features.
    
    - Some features are dropped.
